# Statistical Data Analysis With Pandas Notebooks

***All work are done by me with publicly available data sets***

## A repository which holds all of my Python projects
 
I have classified my notebooks into 2 types

1 - *Basic Types which takes user input and performs functions* (E.g. MagicTrick.ipynb)

2 - *Performing A Statistical Analysis* (E.g.IPL Auction 2020 Analysis.ipynb)

## Check out Analysis of IPL Auction 2020 for a complete guided [tutorial](https://github.com/Thesavagecoder7784/PythonNotebooks/blob/master/Analysis%20of%20IPL%20Auction%202020.ipynb)

**I personally recommend you to try out [this](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1JJSTd0jVsw_Wa82gsexqUCPT9ErfDT0W?usp=sharing)
(Execute and run the cells in colab)**

## Always remember to improvise and beautify your code

### Here's one of my own example:

**Before:**
